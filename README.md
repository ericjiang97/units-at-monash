# Monash Unit Handbook Viewer (Units@Monash)

This project was started for me to explore [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). Whilst building something that might be useful the same time.

This was built on top of the [monPlan](https://monashunitplanner.github.io) API, where we can fetch unit information from the handbook and more it much more easier to use.
